            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>I possess over thirty years of strong software development experience in
                various industries. JavaScript, Java, Python and web related environments are my
                specialty with a strong emphasis on cloud native serverless solutions in AWS,
                Azure and Google Cloud. I have been instrumental in architecting and building out
                various modules and serverless systems in multiple cloud providers.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that this site not only serves as my resum√© but as also a
                demonstration of my work. I am using Vue.js with HTML5 semantics, app cache, media
                queries for responsive layouts, border radius, box shadow, box reflection,
                animation, transitions, 3D transforms and gradients. Feel free to head over to my
                github page to view my development for this site. You can find a link along with
                several contact methods at the bottom of this page.</p>
